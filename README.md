## 🧠 How It Works

- **Tasks are saved** in the browser’s local storage as an array of objects.
- Each task contains:
  - `name` (text)
  - `status` (true/false)
  - `priority` (true/false)
- When users interact (add/delete/status/priority), the list is updated in both UI and storage.

5. Use 🗑️ to delete tasks
